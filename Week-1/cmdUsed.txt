find dest -ctime -60 # change time 60min
  	   -atime # access time
	   -mtime # modified time
ln src dest # src file you want to link to dest = destination of shortcut

touch - creates regular file
find ./ -type f  # show only regular files in specified directory

Inode is a special key that has in itself GID,SID,time of change,size of file and other metadata
it is useful for identifying a file 
Files have to identificatiors the Inode and the Name of the file 

Hard Link is a pointer to a directory with the same Inode as the directory it is pointing to
In order to totally remove the file every hard link must be deleted. ( Basically every hard link acts like a original of the file it is linked to )

To see more detail about file ( example . Inode , size , atime ,ctime mtime )
	stat <file_name>

The mtime in the file is changed when me save file, add new stuff in it.
When mtime is changed the ctime is changed too.

If we only change the Inode or the metadata in the Inode then we only change the ctime and not the mtime .
Example. chmod changes only the ctime of the file 

ls -i  shows the inode numbers
df -h shows the size of files

Acces time is when you open the file

Soft links work as shortcuts. They have different Inodes than the file they redirect to. 
If you delete the original file the soft link won't be deleted.

Sticky bit = t in the end of the permission means that the file has root access

To be root :
 sudo su root 

find ./ -group group_name -perm 002 // only write permission

find ./ -perm -g=w  # will take all the fiels that have write perm on group
find ./ -perm g=w # will only look for files that will have only group write perm

find -anewer file # find files that are newer then give file 
find -anewer file -exec rm {} \; # remove files that are newer than given file
tar -czvf arhiva.tr b* # add all files that start with the letter b to the arhiva.tr

Soft links work as shortcuts. They have different Inodes than the file they redirect to. 
If you delete the original file the soft link won't be deleted.

Sticky bit = t in the end of the permission means that the file has root access

To be root :
 sudo su root 

find ./ -group group_name -perm 002 // only write permission
